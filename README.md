# Airline Fans 101

## Project Goals

For someone that used to work in the Airline industry that travels the world, and meeting different people onboard flights, it was always drilled into our minds that when someone travels from point A to point B, whether for business, reconnecting with family and friends, or wanting to see the world, or on a holiday… That journey experience and excitement begins the moment they step foot onboard that plane. 
So everything that we do in terms of service and product offering will make or break the customer or passengers experience of the airline. 
Although not every passenger or customer may have that excitement being onboard, as they would like to just arrive to their destination in comfort, but there are a select number who takes their interest in airline travel to the next level. 
They are what we call the “Aviation Geeks” or “AvGeeks.” They love everything about the aircraft. They would have extensive knowledge on the aircraft types, onboard service, airline meals specific to the route, aircraft seats to knowing which seat numbers are the best for take off or landing. 
They would even collect anything that is offered to them onboard such as airline magazines, amenity kits, to even plastic cups with airline logos. With the power of social media, you could also spot an AvGeek who will take lots of photos of airline window views to taking pictures of their airline meal, or the millions of postings about the newest Airbus or Boeing aircraft models.
Even before working as a Flight Attendant, I already considered myself as an AvGeek! This is one of the reasons why I created this project, because of my love for the airline industry, and also have a platform for fellow Aviation Geeks or Airline Fans like myself, share their inflight experience or their favourite aircraft or airline. 
Buckle up! And get ready for take-off! And get yourself immersed in the world of Airline Fans 101!
